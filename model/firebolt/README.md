## Complete 3D model for Firebolt

This is the complete model file for the Firebolt minilab.   

* The 3D models have been compressed and uploaded due to size limitations.

* This includes all 3D models that make up the Firebolt, with personal logos and watermarks removed.

* All rack ears and shelves are designed to fit the Rackmate T1.

I hope this will be helpful for your mini-homelab project!
